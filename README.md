# Bias Audit Report – Loan Prediction Classification ML

## Group Project – Tech Career Accelerator (CAPACITI)

**Program:** Tech Career Accelerator (CAPACITI)  
**Project Type:** Bias Analysis and Mitigation in Machine Learning  
**Application:** Loan Prediction Classification Model  
**Team Size:** Individual / Group Project  

---

## Project Overview

The **Bias Audit Report** focuses on evaluating and mitigating potential biases in a loan prediction machine learning model. The project identifies affected demographic groups, quantifies bias using multiple fairness metrics, and implements mitigation techniques to improve equity in model predictions. Visualizations and statistical analyses support findings, while recommendations provide actionable insights for ethical AI deployment.
