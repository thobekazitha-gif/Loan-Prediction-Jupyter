## 📘 Overview
The **Loan Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not based on client-related factors such as income, credit score, loan amount, employment years, and gender.  

The system combines **data analytics** and **predictive modeling** to help financial institutions and funding bodies make data-driven lending decisions efficiently and accurately.
